<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<hr>
<p>Tily renders tiles in a canvas element. It doesn&#39;t do lighting or scripting, pathfinding or AI, or anything else that you might normally expect from a game engine. It just renders tiles. You&#39;ll have to provide the rest yourself :)</p>
<p>The basic idea is that each tile is a string character. And since it&#39;s in a browser, you can use icon fonts.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick overview of how it all fits together:</p>
<h2 id="the-starting-point-tily-main-">The Starting Point - <code>Tily.Main</code></h2>
<p><code>Tily.Main</code> is the starting point and the main wrapper for everything. It handles the canvas element and runs the rendering loop. This can all be configured with options, so if you want to do the render loop or handle resize events yourself, that&#39;s all possible.</p>
<p>This object has a property <a href="../Tily.Main.html#activeBuffer"><code>activeBuffer</code></a> that represents the buffer currently being rendered. You can switch between buffers (with or without a fade transition) by calling the <a href="../Tily.Main.html#activateBuffer"><code>activateBuffer()</code></a> method.</p>
<h2 id="buffers-tily-buffer-and-tily-cellbuffer-">Buffers - <code>Tily.Buffer</code> and <code>Tily.CellBuffer</code></h2>
<p>A buffer is a container for tiles. Specifically, a buffer has a z-ordered list of layers, where each layer has various settings like foreground/background colours, font, opacity and also an array of strings for each tile.</p>
<p>Cell-buffers are slightly different. When you create a cell-buffer, you define a cell function which is responsible for generating cells, each of which is a rectangular chunk of tiles. The cell-buffer figures out which cells are currently visible, gets them from the cell function, caches them, then renders them in the correct position. This means you can make infinite-scrolling buffers if you like.</p>
<p>Buffers are handle their own camera offset and zoom settings, so you can have different initial settings and constraints for each buffer. See <a href="camera.htm">Panning and Zooming the Camera</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Both kinds of buffer also have a list of Active Tiles, which can be used for moving objects, animations, etc.</p>
<h2 id="layers-tily-tilelayer-">Layers - <code>Tily.TileLayer</code></h2>
<p>Tile layers are grids of tiles, where each tile is a character or string.</p>
<p>Tile layers have settings for foreground and background colour, font, opacity and clipping (so you can clip the edges of each tile) and an array of strings for each tile. You can set tiles directly or fill a rectangular area with a particular character.</p>
<p>If any tile has an empty string, the tile will be skipped, meaning that the background colour (if set) won&#39;t be rendered for that tile. Also, if a tile has a string with length greater than 1, the characters in the string will be drawn on top of each other.</p>
<h2 id="active-tiles-tily-activetile-and-tily-activetilelayer-">Active Tiles - <code>Tily.ActiveTile</code> and <code>Tily.ActiveTileLayer</code></h2>
<p>Active tiles can be used for any element that you want to move around or animate. Each active tile has its own position and z-index, so you can move them around inside a buffer or cell-buffer.</p>
<p>Each active tile has a list of layers, and each layer has its own list of sub-layers. You can nest layers as deep as you like. Settings like offset, scale and rotation are inherited by sub-layers, so you can set up quite complex transforms and animations. See <a href="animation.htm">Animating and Transforming Active Tiles</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Active tile layers each have a character or string. If this string has a length greater than 1, the entire string will be rendered as normal. This is so you can use active tiles to render text.</p>
